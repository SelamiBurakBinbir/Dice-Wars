Meet the project that I’ve enjoyed creating the most by far!

Dice Wars is an HTML5 board game where players or bots take turns to conquer a colorful grid of cells using dice rolls. Each turn, they attack adjacent territories, comparing dice totals to determine the victor. The gameplay combines luck and strategic planning, as successful conquests reward extra dice for future offensives.
